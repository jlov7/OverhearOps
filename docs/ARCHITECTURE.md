## State schema
```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, TypedDict

class State(TypedDict, total=False):
    msg: Dict[str, Any]
    intents: List[str]
    team: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    plans: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    branches: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    artefacts: Dict[str, Any]
    verdict: Dict[str, Any]
    risk: Dict[str, Any]
```

## Components
- **apps/service:** FastAPI app exposing health, WebSocket stream, `POST /run/{thread}` trigger, and `GET /runs/{id}` retrieval. Persists artefacts under `runs/` and pipes spans to OTEL.
- **packages/agentkit:** LangGraph 1.0 StateGraph nodes (overhear intent detection, AgentInit-inspired team composer, planner, executor, judge, uncertainty gate).
- **packages/obs:** Observability helpers (OTEL bootstrap, dual exporter writing OTLP + local `spans.jsonl`, span-to-graph builder, defence heuristics) citing LangSmith/Langfuse integrations.
- **apps/ui:** Next.js App Router UI mirroring Adaptive Cards <=1.5. Streams the Teams-style thread, renders Cytoscape span graph, ribbons, and governance modal.
- **infra:** Docker Compose launching Jaeger and OTEL collector for local tracing.
- **data/demo:** Teams-shaped NDJSON threads for deterministic replay.

## Data flow
1. `apps/service/replay.py` replays NDJSON messages via WebSocket for demos and tests.
2. FastAPI service stores latest message, invokes LangGraph with SQLite checkpointer for resumability.
3. Nodes emit spans via OTLP exporter and the file exporter, writing `runs/{run_id}/spans.jsonl` for replay + action/component graphs.
4. The service derives `graphs.json`, stores `artefacts.json`, and persists `hash.txt` (SHA-256 of span timeline) alongside the raw spans.
5. Next.js UI fetches `/run/{id}` and `/runs/{id}/graphs.json`, displays verdict, ribbons, Cytoscape action graph, and the governance modal with replay hash + reproduce command.

## Span model
- `spanify(name)` decorates each LangGraph node, capturing `agent.role`, `overhearops.thread_id`, inferred branch identifiers, and approximate token flow in/out.
- Parent span context is preserved so the action graph mirrors the runtime order and respects the branch-width cap from `OVERHEAROPS_BRANCH_WIDTH`.
- `OVERHEAROPS_RUN_ID` pins the SQLite checkpointer thread and ensures spans land in `runs/{id}/spans.jsonl` for replay and downstream graphs.
- Replay hashes run over ordered `(span_id, name, start, end)` tuples, guaranteeing deterministic verification alongside persisted artefacts.

## Deployment notes
- Python 3.12 managed via `uv`; Node 20 for UI runtime.
- Environment variables documented in `.env.example` (OTEL endpoint, DB path, thresholds).
- SQLite checkpointer default path `overhearops.db`; override with `OVERHEAROPS_DB` or env for tests.
- Container-friendly: run `task dev` (starts collector via Docker Compose, backend via uvicorn, UI via npm).
- Future integrations: Microsoft Graph adapter, LangSmith/Langfuse OTEL exporters, governance modal with span IDs.

## Adapter seam
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI[Next.js UI] -->|REST/WebSocket| API
    Playground[Agents Playground] -->|Adaptive Card| API
    API -- ADAPTER=demo --> Demo[NDJSON demo adapter]
    API -- ADAPTER=graph --> Graph[Teams Graph stub]
    API -- ADAPTER=playground --> Exporter[Plan card exporter]
    Demo --> Threads[data/demo/threads]
    Graph --> "(future) Microsoft Graph"
```
Runtime selection happens via the `ADAPTER` environment variable. `graph` mode validates credentials and otherwise raises a clear error, keeping the seam ready for future wiring whilst demo and playground remain credential-free.

## Governance & replay
- Each run sets `OVERHEAROPS_RUN_ID`, enabling the file exporter to append spans and the service to calculate a replay hash.
- The governance modal surfaces trace IDs, branch counts, and the reproduce command (`uv run apps/service/replay.py --thread ci_flake --seed 42`).
- Determinism is enforced by hashing `(span_id, name, start_ts, end_ts)` and storing the value in `runs/{id}/hash.txt`.
- The uncertainty gate implements an abstain policy: low-confidence verdicts prevent artefact shipment and surface a blocked banner in the UI.
